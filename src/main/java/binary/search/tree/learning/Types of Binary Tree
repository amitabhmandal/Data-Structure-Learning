Types of Binary Tree
1. Full Binary Tree - A full binary tree sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree
is a tree which every node other than the leaf nodes has two children

2. Complete Binary Tree:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled
and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

It can have between 1 and 2h nodes at the last level.
