The nodes can be primitive or non-primitive.

Each node contains
1. A value (some sort of item)
2. A reference or pointer to the left child (may be null)
3. A reference or pointer to the right child(may be null)
4. A binary tree may be empty(contain no nodes)
5. If not empty then the binary has a root nodes
6. Every node in the binary tree is reachable from the root node by a unique path
7. A node with no left and right child is called the leaf node.
