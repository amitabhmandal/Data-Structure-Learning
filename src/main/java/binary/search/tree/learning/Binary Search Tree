In computer science binary search tree(BST) sometimes called ordered or sorted 
binary trees are a particular type of container: data structures that store items
in memory

A binary tree is sorted if every node in the tree is larger than or equal to it's 
left descendants and smaller than or equal to it's right descendants.
