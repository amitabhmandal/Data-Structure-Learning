Two questions that needs to be answered

1. How much space it takes to store data in the memory to execute the algorithm?

Space Complexity! Since RAM and secondary storage is cheap hence we don't quite worry about space
complexity. 

2. How much time it takes to run the algorithm?

Time Complexity!


Types of Time Complexity Analysis:
1. Worst Case  :  
2. Best Case   : It is usually bogus as we don't care about it.
3. Average Case: It is usually complex hence we don't worry too much about it.


RAM model of Computation:
Assumptions:
1. We have infinite memory
2. Each operation whether it is mathematical/or any other takes one unit of time.
3. For each memory access unit time is consumed.
4. Data may be accessed from the RAM or disk, it is assumed that the data is in the RAM.
