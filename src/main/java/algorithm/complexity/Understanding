Algorithm: Any piece of code which performs a desired task is called algorithm

===================================
linear Time
===================================
Algorithms that scale up linearly.
If the code is looping with a single for loop. The the time taken to complete the loop
depends on the number of elements present in the loop.

Hence there is direct relation between the size of the loop and the time taken to process it.

Hence we can time taken is 'N'

===================================
Constant time
===================================

public getElementFrom(int[] a, int index){
	return a[index]
}

Will always fetch the element value in constant time.

Regardless how big the array size is it will return the value in constant time

===================================
Quardratic time
===================================
public int countDuplicates(int items[], int items2[]){
	int count = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i < items1.length ; i++) {
		for(int j = 0 ; j < items2.length ; j++) {
			if(items1[1] == items2[j]){
				count ++;
			}
		}
	return count;
} 



===================================
Big O notation - Worst Case
===================================
How run time scales with respect to some input variables

Rules for calculation
1. Different steps to get added
2. Drop constants 
3. Different inputs use different variables
4. Drop non-dominate terms
